Notes on states:

- Possibly consider "owner" or hitbox.type to assign hitboxes so taht way all hitboxes aren't destroyed in playerUpdateAnimation.

Todo:
- when PlayerHitbox collides with Parent_Enemy hitbox --> player.health -= _enemy.attack
- fix speeds
- fix enemy ignoring collisions when moving
- fix enemy weird buggy movement
